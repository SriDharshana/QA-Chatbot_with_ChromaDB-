A chatbot using FAISS, Sentence Transformers, and DistilBERT for accurate question-answering based on document retrieval. Ideal for efficient knowledge management and support.


# Document Retrieval Chatbot with RAG

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that uses FAISS for efficient similarity search, Sentence Transformers for embedding text data, and a question-answering model (DistilBERT) for generating answers based on retrieved content. This chatbot retrieves relevant text passages from a document collection to answer user queries accurately.

## Features
- **Document Embedding**: Uses Sentence Transformers to encode text documents for similarity matching.
- **Document Retrieval**: FAISS and ChromaDB are used for efficient retrieval of relevant documents.
- **Question-Answering**: DistilBERT QA model provides accurate answers to user questions based on retrieved context.

## Prerequisites
